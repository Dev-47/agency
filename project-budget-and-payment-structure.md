### ðŸ’° Project Budget & Payment Structure â€” *Dev 47*

At **Dev 47**, we uphold a **fair and transparent payment structure** for every team member contributing to a project.

---

#### ðŸ”¢ Standard Budget Allocation:
Each role is assigned a percentage that reflects its typical involvement and responsibility:

- **Team Lead** â€“ 30%  
- **Project Manager** â€“ 10%  
- **Frontend Developer** â€“ 20%  
- **Backend Developer** â€“ 20%  
- **Product Designer** â€“ 20%  

---

#### ðŸ”„ Role-Based Redistribution (When Team Is Smaller):
If a project includes only a subset of these roles, the budget is **redistributed proportionally** among them based on the original percentages.

**Example:**  
If only the **Team Lead**, **Frontend Developer**, and **Backend Developer** are working on a project, their adjusted shares would be:
- **Team Lead**: 30 / (30+20+20) = **43%**  
- **Frontend Developer**: 20 / (30+20+20) = **28.5%**  
- **Backend Developer**: 20 / (30+20+20) = **28.5%**

This ensures that compensation reflects each personâ€™s contribution fairly.

---

#### ðŸ“¢ Full Budget Transparency:
At **Dev 47**, we always notify the team of the **entire project budget received from the client** before the project begins. Transparency builds trust and allows everyone to stay aligned.

---

#### ðŸ’¸ Payment Schedule:
- We **collect the project upfront** from the client **before** the project starts.
- Every involved team member receives **their first payout (part of their share)** exactly **two weeks** after the project commences.
- The **remaining balance** is paid **once the project is completed**.
- Alternatively, you may choose to **receive your full share at the end** of the project if you'd prefer a lump sum payment.

This system is designed to balance security, flexibility, and cash flow for everyone involved.
